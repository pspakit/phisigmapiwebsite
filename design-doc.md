# Design Document: Phi Sigma Pi Forward Facing Website with Attendance Logger Component

## Overview

The website "phisigmapiunc.com" serves as the main forward facing website for the Alpha Kappa chapter of Phi Sigma Pi (PSP) at UNC. The website should inform potential new members (PNMs) about the values of PSP as well as the process to get involved. Further, the website should allow siblings to log in to view their standings within the chapter and log attendance to events.

## User Stories

> Note: The Forward facing website will be similar to the current page, except with a design refresh

### Story A

As **Mary Maybe Member** I want to be greeted with a pleasing homepage upon fist loading the website.

- The homepage should provide highlights on the most important parts of PSP
- It should also provide direction on how to navigate the website (i.e. what information is where)
- The overall theme of the website should incorporate the colors of PSP
- Website navigation should be easily accessible at the top of the page
- Socials and other forms of contact should be included at the bottom of this page

### Story B

As **Any Persona** I want to navigate to `/recruitment` to see a description of the requirements PNMs need to know about the recruitment process. I also want to navigate to `/about` to learn more details about the chapter.

- The pages should include relevant graphics and charts such as rush process
- Content can come from the current recruitment and about page

### Story C

As **Any Persona** I want to navigate to `/gallery` to see a collection of images taken by the chapter.

- This needs to be fixed from the old website, as it was loading way too slow
- Possibly consider a swiping interface, or split images into pages of 100(?) to fix the slowness problem

### Story D

As **Sara Sibling, Christian Chair, and Anna Admin** I want to be able to log in using the login form, accessible at `/login`

- The login should be persistent for a month(?), to prevent users from needing to login every time
- Accounts should be able to be created using `/signup` with fields for email, name, password, etc.
  - Accounts should only be able to be logged into upon activation to prevent randoms from accessing the restricted portion of the website

### Story E

As **Sara Sibling, Christian Chair, and Anna Admin** I want to be able to check into events to log my attendance by visiting `/checkin` and clicking the "Check-In" button on the appropriate event.

- Users should be redirected here after a valid login attempt
- Users with valid JWT tokens should also be redirected here upon navigating back to the webpage
- The "Check In" navigation tile should be shown and able to be clicked to these personas
- Current and upcoming events should be shown here
- Credit fulfillment state should be shown here
